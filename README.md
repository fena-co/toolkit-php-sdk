Simple new payment looks like:

use Fena\PaymentSDK\Payment;

$connection = Connection::createConnection(
    $integrationId = '8afa74ae9fe8be53db50',
    $integrationSecret = '55d7d5ed-be22-4321-bb3f-aec8524d8be2'
);

$payment = Payment::createPayment(
    $connection,
    $amount = '10.00'
    $reference = 'AA-11',
);

$payment->process();
```

**Optional: Set User or Pre Selected Provider For New Payment**

```php
use Fena\PaymentSDK\Connection;
use Fena\PaymentSDK\Payment;
use Fena\PaymentSDK\Provider;
use Fena\PaymentSDK\User;

$connection = Connection::createConnection($terminalId, $terminalSecret);
$payment = Payment::createPayment(
    $connection,
    $amount = '10.00',
    $reference = 'AA-11',
);

$user = User::createUser(
    $email = 'john.doe@test.com',
    $firstName = 'John',
    $lastName = 'Doe',
    $contactNumber = '07000845953'
);
$payment->setUser($user);

$provider = Provider::createProvider(
    $providerId = 'lloyds-bank',
    $sortCode = '123456',
    $accountNumber = '12345678'
);
$payment->setProvider($provider);
```
